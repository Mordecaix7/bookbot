Git process:

Good commits tend to be small. Push a commit after adding a new feature, fixing a bug, reworking code to be readable.
Usually 2-3 commits per hour.

1) Make a change.
2) View the diff.
To view the diff in pycharm, navigate to view -> commit. This opens up the local changes section.
You can right click the files there to open the diff views.
3) Stage the change
To stage the change use the command git add . to stage all the changes in your current directory. If you
only want to stage specific ciles, you could listem them one by one, or ignore them using a .gitignore file.
4) Commit the change.
Use the command:
git commit -m "Your message"
with an identifying message to describe what was changed.
5) Push the change to github.
git push origin main
git push pushes local changes to a remote location liek github.
origin is a name that refers to your github repo for the project. It was configured automatically when you cloned the repo.
Main is the default branch for your repo.

Regarding letter count solution. My approach was to generate an empty dictionary of all letters, iterate through text,
If the letter is a letter (checked against a list of letters), increment its key.
A more elegant and less memory intense solution is to iterate through, and generate the dictionary dynamically, checking
if the letter exists in the dictionary, and if so, increment, else set its value as 1 with itself as a key.
